# cnn-single-sweep-detector
Pipeline for detecting selective sweeps with convolutional neural networks, developed during the GHIST 2025 competition. Supports sweep simulation with discoal, image conversion from .ms and .vcf.gz, CNN training with SWA, and prediction on VCF-derived images. 

This pipeline was partially inspired by the methodology in _The Unreasonable Effectiveness of Convolutional Neural Networks in Population Genetic Inference_ (Flagel, Brandvain, & Schrider, 2018). Please cite their work if you use this pipeline in research.
